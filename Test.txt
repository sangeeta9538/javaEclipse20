1).  Java is an object oriented program language developed by Sun micro system in 1995.Father of java is James Gosling.
     -java is platform independent
     -it is robust and dynamic in nature.
     javac-is a java compiler file which provides tools to compile the code and generates the .class file
	 reads source files written in the Java programming language, and compiles them into bytecode class
	 syntax- javac filename.java
	 java-java file is used to run a .class file which converts bytecode into machine level language
	 
2). JDK-develops application in java it consist of comliler debuger javaDoc.JDK is a platform dependent means every platform need different 
    JRE- stands for java runtime environment.if gives tools to run a java application and provides classes.
    JVM-java vertual machine.it is present in JDK and Jvm.it is responcible to run a program as it consists of inbuilt tools for both
    JDK and JRE. It exectes the program line by line thus it is called as interpreter also.

3).	.java file-it is use to run a .class file which converts bytecode into machine level language
    .class file-it converts java code into bytecode which generates .class file so that it is used by the JVM
	
4).java IDE's-Eclipse,inteliJ,notepad++,notepad,netbeans,VS code

5).Variable-Variable is a container which is used to store a value.It can be chanded or rewrite the value.
    syntax:  
	      DataType variableName=value;
		  String variables are in double cotes
		  String name="x-Workz";
		  
	Types of variables
	1)Instance variables:declared inside the class but outside the method
	2)Local variables:are declared inside the methods.
	3)static variables: variables written with keyword static are called static variables
	4)parameters:are the values decalred inside the braces in methods
	
	
	
6).Object-oriented programming has several advantages  programming:

OOP is faster and easier to execute
OOP provides a clear structure for the programs

	
7).  output-  could not find or load a main class Xworkz

	
	
8). DataTypes:are used to store a value of perticular fixed type
    Types of datatypes-primitive datatypes and nonprimitive datatypes
	
	primitive datatypes-are given a diffrent size for different type of Datatype
	int, float ,char , boolean , double,long,byte,
	
	nonprimitive datatypes:are classes and not fixed in size
	strings ,classes, nested loops,arrays
	
	
9). Dot operator-it is used to access the methods and data members of the class
     syntax:
	 reference.method();
	 reference.dataMember;
	 
10).Java features
     1.object oriented
	 2.platform independent
	 3.robust
	 4.Dynamic Implementation
	 multithreded
	 distributed secured
	 interpreted
	 portable
	 secured
	 high performance
	 
	 
11).Arrays-is a collection of similar data types written inside the curly brackets
    syntax:
	dataType arrayName[]={values};
	
	ex: int arrayNum[]={45,86,65,95,44};


12).class-class is a blueprint which is used to create an object.it includes dataMembers and methods
    syntax:
    accessspecifier ClassName{
		
	}
    object - is an instance of class or real word entity which has states and behaviors

13).Keywords-are reserved word that has predifined meaning in java.
    case: is used in switch statements to write a logic
	this:is used in constructor chaining to call one constructor from another constructor
	break: is used in loops to come out of the loops
	continue: is used to skip the iteration
	instanceof:checks object is instance of specific class or not
	double: is used to store a double type value of 16 bits
	int: is used to store a int type value of 8 bits
	float: is used to store a float type value of 8 bits
	super:is used in constructor chaining to call one constructor from another constructor.this is default and use as first statement
    default:is used to store the default values
	char:is used to store a char type value of 2 byte
	static :is used to declare datamembers and methods as static their values cant be changed
	
14). constructor: is a special method which does not have a return type and has same name as classname
     it is used to instantiate the variables declared in the class
     it is also used in object creation and constructor chaining
	 constructor object creation provides: makes the copy of an object
	                                       allocates memory
										   accesses the instance valriables
										   loads the constructor
										   returns the values
										   
	 
	 types:default constructor
	       parameterized constructor
		   no parameterized constructor
		   
	syntax:
	
	accessSpecifier constructorName(){
		
	
	}
     
	ex:public class Dog{
		
		public Dog(){
			
			
		}
	}
	
	
15). why main method is static: so that jvm may call it without having to create an instance of class that contains the main function
	 
	 method types :static methods and non static methids
	 
	 
	 
16)  

    public class Ant {
		
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		 int[] arr= {12,3,2,45,6,7,6};
		
		System.out.println(arr.length);
		
	}
	

}

	



17). method overloading:
     declaring and reusing methods having same name but diffrent in datatypes or number of parameter
	 
	 ex.
	 public class A{
		 
		 public void display(){
			 System.out.println("this is display method");
		 }
		 
		 public void display(int x, int y){
			 System.out.println("this is display method with parameters of type int");
 
		 }
		 		 
				 
		public void display(double a, double b){
			 System.out.println("this is display method with parameters of type double");
		 
		 
	 }
	 
	method overriding:  allows subclass to provide a different implementation of method that already provided by its parent class 
	 public class Animal{
		 
		 public void bark(){
			 System.out.println("this is bark method in parent class");
		 }
	 }
	 public class Dog extends Animal{
		 		 public void bark(){
			 System.out.println("this is bark method in child class");
		 }
	 }
	 
	 public class AnimalRunner{
		 public static void main(String[] args){
			 
			 Dog dog=new Dog();
			 dog.bark();
		 }
	 }
